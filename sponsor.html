                <h2>Why should your business or organization become a sponsor for Shenandoah Valley Pride?</h2>
                <p>Your business or organization's sponsorship of Shenandoah Valley Pride will send a message that you
                    are a supporter and value the diversity of the LGBTQ community in the local area. Consider that
                    According to Unite Virginia, LGBTQ consumers are big business:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>$884 billion purchasing power</li>
                    <li>$100 billion LGBTQ travel industry</li>
                    <li>Spend $2,300 on leisure and travel every year (compared to the $1,500 that non-LGBTQ consumers
                        spend)</li>
                    <li>97% took vacations in the past 12 months (compared to the national average of 64%)</li>
                    <li>71% will remain loyal to a brand that is LGBTQ-friendly, even if that brand is more expensive or
                        less convenient</li>
                    <li>87% prefer brands that have equal benefits for LGBTQ employees (as do 75% of non-LGBTQ
                        consumers)</li>
                    <li>23% have switched brands in the past year because a competitor was unsupportive of the LGBTQ
                        community</li>
                    <li>47% are more likely to purchase from a company that directly advertises to an LGBTQ audience
                    </li>
                </ul>
