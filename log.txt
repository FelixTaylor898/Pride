Logging the aesthetic and technical decisions/changes made while developing this site.

- Found a premade widget to embed the Facebook page and used that, rather than all the javascript functions.
This loads significantly faster, and allows the user to load more items as they scroll.
- Used Bootstrap for the visual/functionality of the navigation bar for accessibility and optimization purposes.
